Explore Question 1:
    - Since the message feature involves multiple components interacting like handling input and backend communications, you would not use a unit test to test the feature

Explore Question 2: 
    - The max message length feature can be isolated and tested on its own without any other moving components. So you would use a unit test to test this feature.
